            "3. Add the zest and apple juice, the honey and soy and sweet chilli sauce, the deglazed pan juices and the vinegar.",
            "4. Cook this down gently to a runny glaze, stir in the coriander and remove from the heat.",
            "5. Taste the sauce, adjust the seasoning and add more soy sauce if you wish.\u00a0",
            "1. Trim the top and base of each apple. Slice each apple in half horizontally.",

            "6. Sprinkle with maldon salt and remove from the heat.\u00a0",
            "For plating: Carve the pork into thin slices. Lay on a platter. Spoon over the sauce. Serve with salty caramelised apples, steamed green beans and roasted new potatoes.\u00a0",
            "Tip: Chill the pork belly before scoring the skin. It is easier to cut when it's cold. Always use a sharp knife. Always rest your meat before carving it, because the heat causes the meat fibres to tense. Resting allows the juices to redistribute themselves as the fibres relax."

Once heated and charred remove the tortilla to a clean tea towel and wrap to keep warm. Repeat until you have warmed all of your tortillas.",

Finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and add it to the bag; add the juice of both lemons to the bag. Seal the bag tightly and use your hands to vigorously massage the marinade into the chicken, making sure that the chicken is evenly coated. Marinate at room temperature while you make the couscous.",

Add the ginger and garlic and cook, stirring, about 1 minute. Add 2 1/4 cups water, the raisins and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Cover, reduce the heat to low and cook until all the water has been absorbed and the couscous is tender, about 12 minutes. Transfer the couscous to a large bowl and stir with a fork to break up any clumps and release excess steam. Set aside.",
            "5. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place on a platter. Lightly oil the grill grates. Sprinkle the chicken liberally with salt and pepper and arrange the pieces skin-side down on the grill, leaving some space between the pieces. Cook until the skin is lightly charred and releases itself from the grill, about 3 minutes. Rotate the chicken about 90 degrees so that the skin won't burn and cook another 3 minutes. Flip and cook for an additional 5 minutes. Cover the grill and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the deepest part of each chicken thigh reads 165 degrees F, about 10 minutes. Transfer to a platter and rest for at least 5 minutes before serving.",
            "6. While the chicken rests, add the remaining 3 tablespoons oil, the almonds, feta, olives, parsley, 1/2 teaspoon salt and some ground black pepper to the couscous. Finely grate the zest of 1 lemon and add it to the couscous; squeeze the juice from both lemons into the couscous and toss to combine.",

            "2. In the same pan, fry the bacon lardons until browned and starting to crisp up, approx 5 mins.  Blanch the peas in boiling water for a couple of minutes, then drain.  Add the peas to the bowl with the shallots and leek and mix together. Allow to cool completely.",
            "3. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 190\u00b0C/gas mark 5.  Roll out 2/3 of the pastry and use to line a loose-bottomed 20cm/8in cake tin, all the way to the top.  Roll out the remaining pastry slightly thinner than before and use a plate about 20cm in diameter as a guide to cut out a circle for the lid.  Refrigerate until needed.",
            "4. Beat 3 of the eggs into the pea and leek mixture and season with salt and pepper. Add the cheddar cheese.",
            "5. Scatter the lardons over the base of the pastry case then crack in 6 eggs.  Pour over the egg, pea and cheese mixture then fold the sides of the pastry down over the edge of the filling.  Brush the rim of the case with the remaining beaten egg.  Top with the pastry lid, pressing to seal.  Use any leftover pastry to decorate the pie if desired.  Finally, brush with more beaten egg and bake in the oven for 50 mins- 1 hour until golden brown and cooked through."

If you can't find precut \"party wings,\" get regular wings, cut off and discard the tips, and separate the wings at the main joint. Wings can vary quite a bit in size, but 3 pounds of average wings will give you a total of 24 to 26 drumettes and wingettes."

Grill the asparagus until slightly charred and pliable on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes for pencil or 5 to 7 minutes for standard. Remove to a platter and reserve at room temperature. Grill each slice of bread until crispy and slightly charred on both sides. Rub each piece of bread vigorously with the raw garlic clove. Reserve with the asparagus.",
            "3. Fill a bowl with cold tap water and the ice cubes. This will be the holding area for the eggs after they have been poached. Keep the bowl near the stove.",
            "4. Fill a medium saucepan two-thirds of the way with water. Add the white vinegar and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat on the burner until the bubbles in the water have subsided. Gently crack and drop each egg into the water. Cook the eggs for 3 to 4 minutes. When done, the whites will be cooked through and the yolks will be warm but still liquid. Using a slotted spoon, remove the eggs from the saucepan and place in the bowl of cold water. Reserve.",
            "5. To assemble the salad: Toss the rocket with half of the lemon juice, a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt. Gently toss the salad until coated with the lemon and olive oil. Add more lemon juice and oil if needed. TASTE IT! The salad should be dressed and flavorful but not soggy. Divide the rocket among 4 individual plates. Arrange the asparagus on top of the rocket on each plate.",
            "6. While dressing the salad, bring the saucepan of poaching water to a simmer. Gently return the eggs to the saucepan until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes. When the eggs are hot, remove them from the pan with a slotted spoon and gently blot on a tea towel to remove any excess water. Immediately place 1 egg on top of the asparagus on each plate. Sprinkle each with some salt, Parmigiano and lemon zest. Drizzle each piece of grilled bread generously with olive oil and cut in half on the bias. Lean the toast halves against each egg.",

Evenly divide the meat into 12 balls and season aggressively with salt and pepper.",

Do not smoosh them again. Cook until the patties are crusty brown on the bottom, 4 to 5 minutes, then flip once and finish the other side while a piece of cheese melts on top, 4 to 5 minutes more. Stack into 3 patties and set aside to rest. Repeat with the remaining patties.",

Cook, leaving the chicken mostly undisturbed, checking every once in a while to make sure the skin is browning evenly and not getting too dark too quickly, and adjusting the heat as needed, until almost all of the meat is white (except for the very top of the breast) and the skin is a deep golden brown and crispy, 30 to 35 minutes. ",
            "5. Remove the bricks or weighted skillet and turn the chicken over using tongs and/or a spatula, being careful not to rip the skin. Continue to cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the breast reads 75\u00b0C, 15 to 20 minutes more.",
            "6. Remove the chicken and let rest for a few minutes before carving. Serve with lemon wedges.",

Rinse off the bones and meat and put them back into the pot. Fill with fresh cold water to cover by 1 inch. Add the yellow onion halves and 1 tablespoon salt. ",

Simmer until the meats are tender but not falling apart, 1 to 1 1/2 hours, then remove the beef shins and pork hocks. (Do not remove the oxtails or pork neck bones at this stage, if using.) When the meats are completely cool, wrap them in plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to serve.",

For the remaining 4 stalks, peel off 2 or 3 layers until you reach the smoother, more tender core. Quarter the peeled stalks lengthwise and then slice thinly across. Reserve the sliced lemongrass for the satay.",
            "5. Add the bruised lemongrass stalks to the broth and continue to simmer until the broth has reduced by about 10 percent from its original amount, about 1 more hour, then strain the broth into a clean pot. If using, pick the meat from the cooled oxtail and pork neck bones (save the beef shins and pork hocks for later) and reserve; discard the bones, onion and lemongrass.",
            "6. Bring the shrimp paste and 2 cups water to a simmer in a small saucepan, then let simmer for 5 minutes. Skim off the foam. Remove from the heat and let sit for 15 minutes for the fine solids to settle to the bottom. Pour the shrimp water into the large pot of stock, leaving the fine solids behind.",
            "7. For the satay: Heat the vegetable oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Add the annatto seeds and let the seeds infuse the oil and turn it red, about 1 minute. Scoop out the seeds with a spoon and discard. Add the shallots to the annatto oil and cook until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic, chilli flakes and the reserved chopped lemongrass and cook until the garlic starts to brown, about 3 minutes. Add 2 tablespoons fish sauce, 4 teaspoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt. ",
            "8. Stir to incorporate and then cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture is sticky and thickened slightly to the texture of loose jam. (The satay is done when a spoon dragged across the bottom of the skillet leaves a trail and the oil begins to separate from the solids.) Turn off the heat and remove half of the satay for serving. Add about 1 cup of the broth to the remaining satay in the skillet and bring to a simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes to infuse, then strain back into the pot with the broth.",

Rather than doing the usual sprout thing of crisscrossing the bottoms, peel the shells of the sprouts, one layer at a time, right done to the centres to give you lots of little sprout leaves. Take a largish frying pan, add 2 tbsp of the fat from the roast potatoes and a little of the butter. Once hot and foaming, add the shallot, garlic, thyme and chillies. Keep stirring and try not to allow the mix to colour.",
            "2. Once the shallot is soft, turn the heat back up, add the sprout shells and cook for a seasoning. Take the crab in a bowl and add some lemon and lime juice to taste. Season with a little salt if needed. Spoon your sprouts into a serving bowl and then place the cold crab over the top finish with the chopped basil and coriander. Drizzle over some olive oil and a little lime and lemon zest.",
            "1. Gently break up your crab shells with a rolling pin (the easiest way to do this is in a large plastic bag). Place a casserole-style pan over a medium heat, add a little vegetable oil. Once hot, add the shallots, fennel and carrot and cook until nicely caramalised. Add the garlic, herbs and spices. Cook for another 2 minutes, then add the fresh tomatoes. Cook for a further few minutes, then add the vermouth, reduce until your base is lovely and thick.",
            "2. Add the crab shells, turbot head and tail. Now add the stock and simmer for about 25 minutes. Taste for seasoning and pass through a sieve. Finish with some butter and the cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. Taste again and add a touch of lemon juice if needed. Serve up in the middle of the table and feast away."

Cut six 6-inch squares of heavy-duty foil and six 1-inch squares of heavy-duty foil. Using the larger foil squares, wrap each sugar cone, molding to the shape of the cone to cover completely and tucking in excess.

Return to the oven until the cones are lightly browned and crisp and hold their shape, 5 to 7 minutes more. Remove the foil tips, and gently remove the foil cone inserts and toothpicks. Discard the toothpicks. Unwrap and reserve the sugar cones for another use. If the tortilla cones are still soft, return them, empty, to the oven, to cook until crisp, 1 to 2 minutes more. ",
            "4. Meanwhile make the sausage filling. Add 2 teaspoons oil to a medium pan over medium-high heat, then add the sausage and peppers. Cook, stirring often and breaking the meat apart, for 1 minute. Continue to cook undisturbed to allow the sausage to brown, 1 more minute. Scrape up the browned bits and cook, stirring occasionally, until the meat is cooked through and browned, about 4 minutes more. Add the pizza sauce and cook until heated through, 1 minute. Set aside and keep warm until ready to use. ",
            "5. Cover the top of a deep pot with heavy-duty foil, wrapping it taut over the top. Using the tip of a knife, cut six 1-inch Xs in the foil spaced evenly apart. When the cones are cool enough to handle, place one cone in each of the slits. ",
            "6. Sprinkle a pinch of the mozzarella inside each cone. Add 1 tablespoon of sauce, followed by a pinch of cheese, another tablespoon sauce and another tablespoon of cheese in each cone. Repeat with the remaining cones. Bake the pizza cones on the lowest rack of the oven until the cheese is melted and the sauce is hot, about 5 minutes. Serve immediately with crushed red pepper, oregano and torn basil leaves.",

Spread with the remaining cauliflower-ricotta mixture, followed by the remaining roasted cauliflower, one-third more of the tomato sauce, one-third more of the mozzarella and one-third more of the Parmesan. Top with the remaining 4 lasagna noodles, cutting just to fit. Then add the remaining tomato sauce, mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover with foil and bake until bubbly and hot, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and cook until the cheese begins to brown, about 10 minutes more. Allow to rest for 10 minutes so the lasagna will cut more easily. Garnish with the parsley.",

Using a sharp skewer, make small pricks over the skin, being careful not to damage the skin too much. In a baking tray carefully pour 150 millilitres of boiling water all over the skin of the duck as this will help to tighten it, resulting in a crisp skin once it\u2019s cooked. Pat the duck dry inside and out. ",
            "2. To make the brining solution, dissolve the sugar and salt in the warm water and then mix in the cold water and add the vinegar. Place the duck in a large roasting dish and pour the solution over it. Chill it for a minimum of 3 hours, or up to 24 hours, turning the duck a few times. Remove the duck and pat it dry, discarding the brining solution. Place it on a wire rack over a large roasting tin and chill, uncovered, overnight. Before cooking, remove it from the fridge and leave it to rest for an hour to hep the skin dry out.",
            "3. Combine the sugar, salt and five spice and rub this thoroughly inside the duck. Stuff the cavity of the duck with the ginger, shallots and star anise. Using a skewer, seal the cavity by weaving it through the skin. Heat the oven to 150\u00b0C. ",
            "4. With the duck still on the roasting rack over the roasting tin, cook for 2 hours 15 minutes, turning it over halfway through. Increase the heat to 240 degrees Centigrade and cook for a further 10-15 minutes to crisp the skin. if you like your duck even crispier, heat a pan of peanut oil to 180\u00b0C, or until a cube of bread turns golden brown in 15 seconds. ",
            "5. Carefully ladle the hot oil over the skin to crisp it further, until the skin turns golden brown. Mix together the runny honey and tamarind paste and stir well. ",
            "6. Toast the Chinese pancakes whole on a low heat in a non-stick frying pan. ",
            "7. Remove and serve with apple, micro herbs and spring onion. You can keep the pancakes warm in a tray covered with foil."

        ],
        "instructions": [
            "1. Boil a full kettle and once boiled, pour the water over the pork belly, skin side up. The pork needs to be held up at an angle so the water runs off the pork immediately. This helps to achieve great crackling.",
            "2. Pat dry and rub both sides with three tablespoons of olive oil, fennel seeds and half the chopped rosemary. Sprinkle liberally with salt and pepper.",
            "3. Cut the ends of each of the onions and cut in half, lay them on the bottom of a roasting tray to create a trivet for the meat. This will stop the bottom of the meat burning and will also give the sauce a lovely flavour.",
            "4. Preheat the oven to 220\u00b0C and roast the pork for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and add 240ml of the chicken stock, return back to the oven for a further 20 minutes before adding another 240ml chicken stock. At this point the skin should have blistered evenly to give a great crackling. If the crackling isn't ready, return to the oven for a further 20 minutes. Turn the oven down to 135\u00b0C, add 10ml of chicken stock and roast for a 2 1/2  hours, check the pork every 20 minutes and top up with water if the stock dries out.",
            "5. Once cooked, remove the pork from the tray and allow to rest for 15 minutes.",
            "6. While the pan juices are still warm, scrape the pan to release all the flavor and strain the juices into a small saucepan. Bring to the heat and reduce a little, being careful not to add any seasoning as the pan juices have reduced a lot during cooking. Set aside until serving.",
            "7. Meanwhile to make the beans, bring a saute pan to the heat, add the remaining olive oil and butter, when bubbling add the shallots and saute on a medium heat for three minutes or until softened. When the shallots are soft, add the garlic and cook for a further two minutes before adding chopped rosemary, stir briefly and add the cream and remaining 150ml of chicken stock. Bring to the boil and reduce the heat and allow the sauce to reduce by a third. Add the beans and stir to warm through. Season and stir through the flat leaf parsley and keep warm until needed.",
            "8. Cut the pork into six even pieces, keeping the crackling intact. The easiest way to do this is with a serrated knife, skin side down. Serve the beans first, top with a piece of pork and drizzle with the pan juices."

This bit is very important \u2013 by very slowly sweating this base of veg and spices off, you bring out all the lovely flavours and sugars \u2013 this provides the base to your chilli. Cook for 10-20 mins, checking occasionally that it\u2019s not catching on the bottom, if it is then your heat is too high.",

When the pan is smoking carefully add the meat \u2013 do this in two batches as to not over crowd the pan. Keep it on and turn until the meat is well caramelised on all sides. The lovely dark colour will add more flavour to the dish.  ",

Stir, replace the cartouche and lid and cook on a very low heat for 3 hours or until the meat is soft and falling apart \u2013 if your meat has been well hung, this process will not take as long.
